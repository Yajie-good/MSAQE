README: MSAQE Framework Implementation
This repository contains the implementation of key components of our data-driven integrated framework for Multi-view Scenic Areas Quality Evaluation (MSAQE). Specifically, it includes code for:

Reference-Based Sentiment Analysis (RBSA): Implements sentiment scoring for scenic areas based on a curated reference dataset and ALBERT fine-tuned sentiment scoring.
Multi-label Classification with GLEE: Implements the Global and Local Ensemble Encoding (GLEE) framework with attention mechanisms for multi-label classification, focusing on scenic area quality dimensions.
